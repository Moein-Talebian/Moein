A microfluidic electrokinetic-based biosensor has been designed and fabricated. An analyte (0.1xPBS) flows into the channels which are covered by silicon dioxide. The electric double layer is created and due to the charge distributions, a small current, known as streaming current, could be measured by two electrodes installed at inlet and outlet of the device. For more information, please take a look at this paper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.1c13192
For the streaming current measurement, the analyte is pushed into the system with trapezuidal pulses between 1.5 and 3 bar with a duration of 30 secodns. Hence, the measured streaming current would have trapezuidal puls shape. 
One would be interested in disecting the trains of streaming current pulses, then find the average of peaks and valleys at each pulse. Then ask the user for the experimental parameters and calculate the zeta potential from the analyzed data and the input from the user. 
The data could be plotted at different stages of analysis and a noise reduction filter could also be developed for the package.
